# vue-media-embed

Embed for YouTube, Vimeo and SoundCloud

This plugin requires [Vuex](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vuex)

### Features
- Auto pause players
- Restore previous state from store

### Installation
```bash
$ npm install vue-media-embed
```
### Usage
```js
import Vue from 'vue'
import VueMediaEmbed from 'vue-media-embed'
import Vuex from 'vuex'

Vue.use(Vuex)
const store = new Vuex.Store({ ... })

Vue.use(VueMediaEmbed, { store })
```
### Example
In this example we embed 3 players
```vue
<vue-media-embed source="soundcloud://295067272" :auto-play="1" :allow-fullscreen="0" />
<vue-media-embed source="youtube://C6vinrXWxls" :auto-play="0" :allow-fullscreen="1" />
<vue-media-embed source="vimeo://70114668" :auto-play="0" :allow-fullscreen="0" />
```
Sources like http://vimeo.com/190613094 and https://www.youtube.com/watch?.. or https://youtu.be/{ID} are fine too

### Overlay
You can display an overlay over the player that will start playback when clicked
```vue
<vue-media-embed source="youtube://C6vinrXWxls" overlayMode="before" />
```

By default the overlay has a black background. You can give it an image to display instead
```vue
<vue-media-embed
  source="youtube://C6vinrXWxls"
  overlayMode="before"
  thumbnail="https://i.redd.it/2jsbryjusg2y.png"
/>
```

And you can use a custom play button element
```vue
<vue-media-embed
  source="youtube://C6vinrXWxls"
  overlayMode="before"
  thumbnail="https://i.redd.it/2jsbryjusg2y.png"
>
  <button>Fancy play button</button>
</vue-media-embed>
```
